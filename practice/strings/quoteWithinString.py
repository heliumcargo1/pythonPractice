chai = "he said,\"the chai is good\"" #to use the quoted text with in a string we have to apply \\ 
print(chai)

# or we could use raw string 

chai = r"he said,'the chai is good'" # here r is used to print the exact raw string, and the string starts with single quote not the double quote
print(chai)                            #or start the string with quoble quote but in the string it should have single quote text
